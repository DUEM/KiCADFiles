# KiCADFiles
A Repository including and storing all KiCad files used on PCBs. 


Hi all Electrical DUEMers.

Here you'll find the KiCAD symbols and footprints used by the team. There are two way to use it. One much better than the other.

1. (BASIC AND NOT PREFFERED ðŸ™„)
  Download the files and import them like any old symbol library or footprint folder - If this step makes no sense then go watch a youtube vid (or see any potential extra documentation)

2. (Alpha Method ðŸ˜Ž ie the Github Method)
	1. Download a git browser for desktop (I (AS) use good ol' GitHub Desktop).
	2. Login... duhh
	3. Copy the **KiCADFiles** repositry to somewhere on your device. OneDrive is also an option.
		1. This creates a local version of the repositry on your device so when someone update the file and uploads the changes to GitHub it can be updated on yours with a single button click. WoooWWðŸ¤ .   
		2. How you may ask??ðŸ¤¨ Magic âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨.
	4. Then import these files as you need them into KiCAD and it should sort out the rest*
  
  
If there's a PDF in this folder it'll contain more info. If not then msg your Head of Electrical.
*I hope.
